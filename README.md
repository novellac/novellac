### Welcome!
Hi I'm Novella (she/her). I'm a frontend developer working to make joyful, sparkly interfaces accessible to all! I work mostly with Vue and plain Javascript. 
- 🌴 In my spare time I like to help folks learn basic computer skills
- 💬 Ask me about project ideas. I have more ideas than I could reasonably use :)
- 🤔 I really hope I make this page more interesting
- 🐣 See [my resume](https://shiny.computer)

## Where did my (keyboard) focus go? (Lightning talk, June 4, 2025)
